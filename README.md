#Arduino

This is a set of arduino projects. 

Most of them are currently how-to's for the set of sensors / outputs at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CS6UMKQ , along with a few other modules. The how-to's are based on the provided code and documents.



Each project includes a readme that explains any relevant setup. Additionally, the pictures folder has a readme with a picture and brief description for each of the modules.



## Disclaimer

These projects are a summary of some of the things I've done with various arduino modules. I am *NOT* responsible for any hardware or software damage in _any way whatsoever_ caused by use of this repository, whether direct or as a guide. If you fry your arduino or a module doing something you saw here, you fried it. I merely told you how. 

By visiting, using, or thinking about this repository you agree that you do so strictly at your own risk and furthermore agree that any damage caused by doing so is completely your responsibility. This repository is provided as-is, without any guarantee of anything. I'm a software dev playing with hardware. Things go boom occasionally.
