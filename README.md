This is a set of arduino projects. 

Most of them are currently how-to's for the set of sensors / outputs at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CS6UMKQ , along with a few other modules. The how-to's are based on the provided code and documents.



Each project includes a readme that explains any relevant setup. Additionally, the pictures folder has a readme with a picture and brief description for each of the modules.
