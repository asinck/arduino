#Magnetic Sensors

This is a collection of sensors for magnetic fields. 

The reed and hall projects have the same code.

Fun fact: I have an arduino uno controlling a power strip, which has my monitors + desk lamp plugged into it. When I was working with these sensors I accidentally uploaded a program to the uno instead of the mega, and the switch no longer worked (go figure). Fortunately I had some foresight when I made the switch and fail-proofed the hardware so that in case of failure the power strip is on.
